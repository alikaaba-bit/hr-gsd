## What Happened

**Project kickoff:** HR-GSD weekly reporting system

### Completed
- [x] Created project directory at `/Users/ali/hr-gsd/`
- [x] Set up context engine structure (MEMORY.md, CLAUDE.md)
- [x] Defined tech stack: Next.js + Supabase + Claude AI
- [x] Drafted database schema (employees, weekly_reports, submission_tracking)
- [x] Outlined GSD weekly questions template
- [x] Defined AI grading criteria (1-10 scale)
- [x] Initialized Next.js 14 app with TypeScript + Tailwind
- [x] Installed Supabase client libraries
- [x] Created employee weekly report form (`/report`)
- [x] Created HR dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- [x] Created AI analysis API endpoint (`/api/analyze`)
- [x] Created Supabase types and client

### File Structure Created

    │   ├── lib/supabase.ts       # Supabase client + types
    │   └── types/

```

### Decisions Made
1. Using same context engine as Petra Mind for consistency
2. Supabase for multi-region team (China/Canada/Pakistan/US)
3. GSD workflow from https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done
4. AI analysis uses Kimi K2.5 (Ali's preference)
5. Email auth (not Google OAuth)

### Next Steps (From Ali)
- [ ] Send exact list of weekly questions
- [ ] Decide: Google OAuth vs email auth
- [ ] Clarify notification preferences (Slack? Email?)
- [ ] Set up Supabase project and run migrations
- [ ] Add auth to the app
- [ ] Test AI analyzer end-to-end

## Notes

Ali wants to track distributed team across 4 countries. Quarterly reviews based on weekly logs. AI analyzer to catch low-effort submissions before quarterly review.
